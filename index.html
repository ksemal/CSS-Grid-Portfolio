                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Ksenia and I live in Holly Springs, NC.</p>
                    <p>I am a highly motivated Web Developer with sense of creativity and ability to grasp new concepts quickly and efficiently.
                        Graduated with two degrees in construction and graphic design, I worked as an engineer and a 3d designer in architectural companies and game industry.
                        After moving to the US I was able to adapt my foreign experience for the US standards and workflow, such as utilizing different measurement systems in the construction documentation,
                        managing projects from small residential to huge retail  construction projects, multi-task working within a team, ability to interact with contractors and clients and effective time management skills.</p>
                    <p>However, in my previous career as a designer I wasnâ€™t satisfied with only being involved in the visual aspect, I wanted a deeper involvement in technical projects with logical thinking and analysis.
                        As a front-end web developer I have the ability to solve problems and understanding of the entire web development process, including web-design, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
                    <p>Now I am expanding my knowledge at UNC Coding Bootcamp fullstack program. Thanks to my previous experience, I could easily utilize creative and engineering approach in my future career as a web developer.</p>
